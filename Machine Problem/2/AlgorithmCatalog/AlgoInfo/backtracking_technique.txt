Backtracking Technique

    Backtracking technique solves the problem by finding
the first optimal solution in the problem, if it did not
find an optimal solution and the solution space is not 
empty, it backs one step and choose other solution.

Some problem it solves includes:
    -n-Queens Problem
    -Sudoko

Example of decrease-and-conquer implemented here is:
    Naive Sudoku solver

    Backtracking technique for solving sudoku is the
easiest yet the slowest way of solving sodoku. The
way it works is somewhat similar to depth-first 
traversal, where when it meets a dead-end, it back-
tracks and continue to search in another path. This
is basically brute force where it tries all the 
solutions.

For the Implementation of this algorithm, we require
the user to:
        1. Do nothing. Just watch.
