BRUTE FORCE

    Brute force solves the problem directly depending 
on how it is defined. It is a straightforward approach.

Some algorithm includes:
    -Selection sort
    -Bubble sort
    -Sequential search
    -naive string-matching

Example of brute force implemented here is:
    BUBBLE SORT

    Bubble sort is the naive way of sorting elements.
The current key basically compares itself to the adj-
acent element and swaps if it satisfies the criteria.
You can see at as like a bubble under the water. The
time complexity of this algorithm is O(n2).

    For the Implementation of this algorithm, we require
the user to:
        1. Use number inputs only.
        2. Use atmost two digits per element.
        3. Separate elements by comma (,).
        4. Example of input is "12,1,34,99,7,0"
