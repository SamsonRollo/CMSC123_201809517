Initialize all distance as infinite

Create an empty priority queue Q
Insert source vertex S and its distance equals zero

While Q is not empty
    Retrieve vertex u, the minimum distance vertex from Q

    Visit every adjacent vertex v of u
        newDistance = distance of u plus distance between u and v
        
        If newDistance is less than distance of v 
            Update distance of v equal newDistance
            Add vertex v to Q
